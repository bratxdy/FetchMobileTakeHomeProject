### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

I prioritized a well tested, extensible networking layer that could be used in a production application. I focused here because I wanted to show off my ability to write extensible, testable, production code.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

Approximately 6 hours

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?

I saved some time by not including every sort of error that could occur in the networking layer such as a lack of internet.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?

I think the weakest part of the project is the UI as I didn't spend much time there.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.

In a production app I'd use an actual dependency injection library like Resolver as well as a good unit test mocking framework like Cuckoo.
